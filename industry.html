      <h2>My Industry</h2>
      <p>I work in the Information Technology (IT) industry, specifically in technical support consulting. This field focuses on diagnosing hardware and software issues, optimizing system performance, and guiding clients through tech solutions. It’s a dynamic space that blends problem-solving, communication, and continuous learning.</p>
